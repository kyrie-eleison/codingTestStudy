Greedy Algorithm

1. Find the best available option in any case.

2. But this greedy algorithm has so many variations, which means memorizing may be burdensome. 
We have no choice but to meet as many exercises as possible.

3. When we think up a possible solution, we need to keep ask ourselves of
the justifibility of that solution.

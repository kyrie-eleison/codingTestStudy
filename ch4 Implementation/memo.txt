Part 2. Ch4: Implementation
Oct.20.2020

1. Implementation Problem indicates a kind of problem which is easy to think of about its algorithm,
but hard to implement as a source code.

2. Examples: long code, lots of conditions in the problem, lack of experience(of standard libraries)

3. Brute Force, Simulation included.
*Brute Force: Finding every possible way to solve the problem
(solve if the data is less than about 1,000,000)

4. Memory Problem: make a list of length(int) less than 10,000,000(=~ 40MB)

5. Speed Problem: Python solves 20,000,000 ops in a second.
-> if the time limit is 1sec & data length =~ 1,000,000 -> we need O(nlog(n)) algorithm

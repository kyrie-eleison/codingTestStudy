Graph Algorithms:

1. Disjoint Set Algorithm
- How to deal with sets
- implement set union and find operations through tree data structure
- Need to keep in touch with parent => root node
- Application: Detecting Loops in a Graph

2. Kruskal Algorithm
- Greedy Algorithm for finding the cheapest way of constructing a spanning tree
- Sort the edges in the order of ascending cost, and include each of them into the 
spanning tree if and only if it does not form a loop

3. Topology Sort
- Sorting nodes which are connected by directed edges
- Use Queue
